In this updated version, I have added a placeholder for configuration defines or includes, which you can use to customize the stack (STK) behavior. I also added a header guard (`#ifndef`/`#define`/`#endif` block) to prevent multiple inclusions of the same header file. Finally, I added a comment block with your name, version, and date, which you can update as needed.
