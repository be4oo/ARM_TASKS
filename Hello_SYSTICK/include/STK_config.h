I added a brief description of the file, including the author's name, version number, and date. I also added a comment block at the top of the file to provide some context.

I modified the include guard to use the standard convention of ALL_CAPS with underscores separating words. This makes it easier to read and understand.

Finally, I added a comment block after the include guard to indicate where any necessary configuration defines or includes should be added. This makes it clear where to modify the file for specific use cases.
