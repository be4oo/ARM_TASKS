/*
 * The following files are included in this codebase:
 * 1. stm32f10x.h: This is a device header file for the STM32F10x microcontroller series. It contains definitions and prototypes for the device-specific peripheral libraries.
 * 2. system_stm32f10x.h: This is a system header file for the STM32F10x microcontroller series. It contains definitions and prototypes for the system-level peripheral libraries.
 * 3. cmsis_device.h: This header file has been added for convenience, and it likely contains definitions and prototypes for the Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS) libraries.
 *
 * These files are sourced from the STM32F10x_StdPeriph_Lib_V3.5.0/Libraries/CMSIS/CM3/DeviceSupport/ST/STM32F10x folder of the STSW-STM32054.zip file.
