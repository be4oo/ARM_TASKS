Here are the improvements made:

1. Added an external declaration for the `SYS_t` variable `STK_private` so that it can be defined in the implementation file `STK_private.c`.
2. Replaced the integer literals with bitwise left shift operator for better readability and to avoid magic numbers.
3. Replaced the `u32` type with the standard `uint32_t` type for better portability.
4. Added `volatile` keyword to the `SYS` macro to prevent compiler optimizations that could lead to incorrect behavior.
5. Added a comment describing the purpose of the header
