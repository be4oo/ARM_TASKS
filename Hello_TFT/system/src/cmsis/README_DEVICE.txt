/*
 * system_stm32f10x.c: This file provides system initialization functions for
 * the STM32F10x microcontroller. It includes functions for initializing
 * the clock system, GPIO pins, and other peripherals.
 */

/*
 * Function: void SystemInit(void)
 * ---------------------------------
 * Initializes the system clock and configures the necessary system
 * configuration registers. This function is called from startup code
 * generated by the STM32CubeMX tool.
 */

/*
 * Function: void SetSysClockTo72MHz(void)
 * ---------------------------------------
 * Configures the system clock to run at 72 MHz. This is achieved by
 * configuring the HSE (high-speed external) oscillator and then
 * selecting the PLL (phase-locked loop) as the system clock source.
 */

/*
 * Function: void SystemCoreClockUpdate(void)
 * ------------------------------------------
 * Updates the SystemCoreClock variable with the current system clock
 * frequency. This function should be called whenever the system clock
 * frequency changes.
 */

/*
 * Function: void ITM_Init(void)
 * -----------------------------
 * Initializes the Instrumentation Trace Macrocell (ITM) for debugging
 * purposes. The ITM is a debugging feature available on some STM32
 * microcontrollers that allows for low-overhead tracing of code
 * execution.
